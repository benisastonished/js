# Solving programming problems

1. Read the problem at least twice
2. Note key numbers and constraints as they will inform the solution
3. Develop the simplest possible solution to the problem. Avoid solving a larger problem unless absolutely necessary
4. Write the pseudo-code implementation first
5. Use simple for-loops first instead of functional-code
6. Refactor to functional style once you have a working solution, if desired
